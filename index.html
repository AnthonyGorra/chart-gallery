## Overview
You will be provided with a Statement of Advice (SOA) document and asked to create or modify financial charts based on the information contained within. Each chart type requires specific information to be extracted from the SOA and formatted according to the chart template.

## General Process
1. Carefully read the entire SOA document to understand the client's situation, goals, and recommended strategies.
2. Identify which chart type is requested based on the financial strategy discussed.
3. Extract the relevant information needed for that specific chart type.
4. Maintain the visual layout and structure of the original chart template.
5. Replace only the client-specific financial data, values, and text while preserving headings and design elements.

## Important Guidelines
- If any required information is missing from the SOA, use "[REDACTED]" as a placeholder. Do NOT ask for missing information - these placeholders will be manually edited later in the drawio app.
- Preserve all visual elements, flow structures, and relationships in the original chart template.
- Format currency values consistently (e.g., $X,XXX).
- Ensure percentages are accurately calculated and represented.
- Verify that all boxes, arrows, and connections in flowcharts maintain their logical relationships.
- Double-check that the sum of allocated funds equals the total amount available.

## Client Information
For each chart, extract and include relevant client information such as:
- Names and ages
- Super fund details
- Account balances
- Tax components
- Contribution caps and eligibility
- Age-based conditions

## Strategy Specifics
For each strategy type, ensure you capture:
- Specific dollar amounts
- Timing of transactions
- Tax implications
- Legal requirements and eligibility
- Fund or account names
- Current vs. proposed structures

## Final Output
Your final output should include:
1. A clear representation of the requested financial chart with all relevant client data incorporated
2. Accurate financial values and percentages where available
3. Preserved visual structure and relationships
4. Logical flow of funds and actions
5. "[REDACTED]" placeholders for any missing information

Do NOT ask for missing information - all placeholders will be manually edited later in the drawio app.

Remember, these charts will be used to explain complex financial strategies to clients, so accuracy and clarity are essential.`
